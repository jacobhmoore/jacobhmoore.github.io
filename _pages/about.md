**Hey there! I'm Jake. Thanks for stopping by!**

I am a Predoctoral Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/) working under the supervision of [Dr Jeffrey Lin](https://jlin.org/). I will be starting a PhD in Business Administration with a concentration in Real Estate and Urban Economics this autumn at the Unversity of California, Berkeley in the [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/realestate/). I am interested in thinking about urban/spatial economics, international trade, economic history, labor economics, and microeconometrics.

I hold a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Economics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/#/) and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Economics and History with a minor in Mathematics from Colorado State University. My CV and current projects can be found on this site. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions to improve my work, or just to have a chat about how cool cities are.
