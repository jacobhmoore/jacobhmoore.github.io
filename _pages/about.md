**Hey there! I'm Jake. Thanks for stopping by!**

I am a Predoctoral Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/). I am an incoming PhD student in Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley's [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/realestate/). I hold an MPhil from the University of Oxford and a BA from Colorado State University.

I think primarily about urban spatial economics and international trade, but I also research topics in economic history, labor economics, and the economics of innovation. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions to improve my work, or just to have a chat about how cool cities are (especially Philadelphia).
