**Hey there! I'm Jake. Thanks for stopping by!**

I am a PhD student in the Real Estate and Urban Economics Section at UC Berkeley's [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/realestate/). Before coming to Berkeley, I was a Research Associate at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. I hold an MPhil from the University of Oxford and a BA from Colorado State University.

I think primarily about urban and spatial economics, international trade, and microeconometrics. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions to improve my work, or just to have a chat about how cool cities are (especially Philadelphia).
