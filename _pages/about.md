**Hey there! I'm Jake. Thanks for stopping by!**

I am a Predoctoral Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/) working under the supervision of [Dr Jeffrey Lin](https://jlin.org/). I am an incoming PhD student in Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley's [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/realestate/). I think primarily about urban spatial economics and international trade, but I also research topics in economic history, labor economics, and the economics of innovation.

I hold a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Economics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/#/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Steve Bond](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/steve-bond/) and [Prof. Tony Venables](https://tonyvenables.weebly.com/). I also hold a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Economics and History with a minor in Mathematics from [Colorado State University](https://economics.colostate.edu/). My CV and current projects can be found on this site. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions to improve my work, or just to have a chat about how cool cities are (especially Philadelphia).
