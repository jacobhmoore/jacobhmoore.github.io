**About Me**

<img align="right" src="https://jacobhmoore.github.io/images/IMG_0014.jpg" alt="Photo" style="width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 12px 12px 12px 12px"/>


I am a PhD student in the [Real Estate and Urban Economics Group](https://haas.berkeley.edu/realestate/) at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Prior to Berkeley, I was a RA at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. I hold a MPhil in Economics from the University of Oxford and a BA in Economics from Colorado State University (go rams).

I think primarily about urban/spatial economics, international trade, and international macroeconomics and finance. My email is jacob.moore [at] berleley.edu.
