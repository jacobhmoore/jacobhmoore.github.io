**Hey there! I'm Jake. Thanks for stopping by!**

I am a Predoctoral Research Analyst at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/) working under the supervision of [Dr Jeffrey Lin](https://jlin.org/). I am interested in thinking about urban/spatial economics, international trade, economic history, labor economics, and microeconometrics.

I hold a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Economics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/#/) and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Economics and History with a minor in Mathematics from Colorado State University. My CV and current projects can be found on this site. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions to improve my work, or just to have a chat about how cool cities are.

**I am applying to Economics (and related) PhD programs during the 2021-2022 admissions cycle.**
